The aim of frogger is to gain points by getting frogs safely across a busy road and a treacherous river to their homes.

Use the arrow keys to move and avoid being squashed by the vehicles, drowning in the river and being eaten by the crocodile.  Collect flies for bonus points and get a time bonus by getting frogs home quickly.
Only a single frog can live in each home and frogs cannot live in a home containing the remains of a frog eaten by a crocodile.  If you get any frogs home you can continue on to the next level(s), which are faster and for which the available time is decreased.

Points:
Goal	10 points
Death  -10 points
